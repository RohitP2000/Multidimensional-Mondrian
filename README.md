We have a multidimensional dataset of adult employee information with varying
attributes. The dataset contains both categorical and continuous values. Before publishing this
data, we need to anonymize the data so that sensitive data about the employees is not leaked.
For this our plan is to use the multidimensional Mondrian k anonymity algorithm and
anonymize the dataset so that it can be published and utilized without loss in utility.
